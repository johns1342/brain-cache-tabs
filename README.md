# Brain Cache Chrome Extension

Brain Cache is a tab finder and contentent manager (eventually).  Right now it's in a POC stage to see what works and what doesn't.

The longer term goal is to support tab and content searching and filtering, both current and historical.  This will require a lot of sensitive browser permissions, but that is one of the reasons this project is open source.  That way users can see the code for themselves if they choose.
